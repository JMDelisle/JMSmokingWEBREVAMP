        <h2 id="centered">Arm yourself with the right tools:</h2>
        <p id="indent6">People spend so much time worrying about what smoker to buy or which type of charcoal to cook
          with they tend
          to forget about accessories.</p>

        <p id="indent7"> Investing in the right accessories for your grill or smoker doesn’t just make your life a lot
          easier, it’ll
          improve the quality of your BBQ too!</p>

        <p id="indent8">You’ll regret not investing in these smoker and grill accessories sooner!</p>

        <p id="indent9">To round out your barbecue tool kit check our guides to the best store-bought rubs and sauces
          and books.</p>

        <p><b>1. A quality wireless meat thermometer</b></p>
        <img src="img/thermometer.jpg" id="fuel" alt="tools" style="width: 35em; height: 15em;">
        <p id="indent12">Our top accessory is a no-brainer if you like to cook barbecue low and slow. If you’ve tried to
          BBQ without a
          meat thermometer I feel sorry for you!</p>
        <p>If your smoker has a built-in lid thermometer you’re not exempt either. These are notoriously inaccurate.
          The best solution is a dual probe bbq thermometer that lets you measure the temperature in your cooker and the
          temperature of your meat from the same device.</p>
        <p>Preferably with wireless functionality so you can check your temps from the comfort of your couch.
          Remember that low and slow is all about consistent temperature.</p>
        <p><b>2. Heat resistant BBQ gloves</b></p>
        <hr>
        <img src="img/bbqgloves.jpg" id="fuel2" alt="bbqgloves" style="width: 35em; height: 15em;">
        <p id="indent13">Your primary goal when you grill and barbecue should be to create delicious smoked meat.</p>

        <p>A good secondary goal is to avoid burning your hands.</p>

        <p>The first time I used a Weber Chimney Starter I got to enjoy a nice shower of scolding hot sparks on my bare
          hands.</p>

        <p> I use a pair of heat resistant BBQ gloves whenever I’m handling charcoal. Gloves are also useful for turning
        food without damaging the bark you work so hard to achieve.</p>
          <hr>
        <p><b>3. A BBQ grill brush to keep your cooking area clean</b></p>
        <img  src="img/wirebrush.jpg" id="fuel3" alt="wirebrush" style="width: 35em; height: 15em;">
        <p>You don’t want to be the person who spends over $1,000 on a Kamado Joe but won’t spend $10 bucks to keep their fancy grill clean.</p>
        <p>Get into the habit of cleaning your grill with a good grill brush after every cook and your life will be a lot easier.</p>
        <p id="indent14">1: After a cook, crank the temperature for around 10 minutes and then clean with a wire brush while all the built-up meaty gunk is fresh.</p>
        <p id="indent15">2: Before the next cook take the inside grate and give it a good cleaning with water while your smoker or grill is coming up to temperature</p>
          <p id="indent16">3: Put the grate back into the grill/smoker and let it get nice and hot before putting food on.</p>
        <p>This way you make sure there are no stray wires getting left behind by the brush and making their way into your food (this is rare but you really don’t want it to happen once!).</p>

        <p><b>4. Sturdy BBQ Tongs</b></p>
        <img src="img/instaread_thermometer.jpg" id="fuel4" alt="thermometer" style="width: 35em; height: 15em;">
        <p>Hold on a second, didn’t we already mention the importance of a thermometer at the top of this article?</p>
        <p>An instant-read meat thermometer actually serves a different purpose.</p>
        <p>A WiFi thermometer is for monitoring the temp in your grill and of your meat during long cooks.</p>
        <p>An instant-read thermometer is crucial for grilling, especially when cooking steaks where every few degrees can have a big impact.</p>
        <p>I also find these useful when cooking low and slow as you can quickly test the temperature at multiple different points.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>6. A basting brush/mop</b></p>
        <img src="img/grillhogs-basting-mop.jpg" id="fuel5" alt="mop" style="width: 35em; height: 15em;">
        <p>Some recipes call for basting the meat with a mop or marinade to add flavor and keep the meat moist.</p>
        <p>Having a dedicated mop for barbecue is useful because of the longer handle and a more durable head.</p>
        <p>The brush you might already have in your kitchen cupboard would probably burn. Not the kind of flavor you want to impart!</p>
        <p><b>7. A quality butcher’s block</b></p>
        <p>A large butcher’s block or cutting board is an essential accessory for any barbecue kitchen.</p>
        <p>Even an average-sized brisket won’t fit on your standard sized kitchen cutting board.A quality wood board will also help keep your knives sharp.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>8. A sharp boning knife for trimming</b></p>
        <img src="img/boningknife.jpg" id="fuel6" alt="knife" style="width: 35em; height: 15em;">
        <p>Out of all my BBQ knives, I find myself reaching for my boning knife the most often.The blade shape makes it perfect for trimming the fat cap on a brisket or tidying up a slab of ribs.</p>
        <p><b>9. A slicing knife for serving perfect portions</b></p>
        <p>If you need a boning knife to trim your meat up before cooking, a slicing knife is just as important for making the final product presentable. A sharp slicing knife can actually make your barbecue taste better, especially when slicing brisket or tri-tip as the right slice will improve the texture.</p>
        <p><b>10. A charcoal chimney fire starter</b></p>
        <img src="img/chimneystarter.jpg" id="fuel7" alt="chimney" style="width: 35em; height: 15em;">
        <p>I would consider this essential if you grill or smoke with charcoal, otherwise it’s not needed.</p>
        <p>Unless you like painstakingly stacking your charcoal over chemical fire starters a chimney starter is your obvious choice. And if you are dousing your charcoal in lighter fluid please stop now!</p>
        <p>Just pour your charcoal into the chimney starter, scrunch up a few paper towels with a few teaspoons of oil and then light. Place the chimney over the ball of paper towels and you should be good to go with 10-20 minutes.</p>

        <h2><b>What type of charcoal and type of wood you can use:</b></h2>
        <p id="indent0">There are different kinds of charcoal? Yup. You’re damn right there are. Like sandwiches,
          insurance plans,
          and automobiles, charcoal is no one-size-fits-all beast.</p>

        <p id="indent10">You’ll find two main types of charcoal out there in the world, and they lend themselves more
          appropriately to
          different grilling situations. So before you give it a light, you need to know what you'll be cooking. Here
          are the two main types of charcoal and what you should be using them for:</p>
        <img src="img/CharcoalBriquettesHardwoodLump.jpg" id="fuel1" alt="bbqfuel" style="width: 35em; height: 15em;">

        <h6>We've got briquttes on the left and hardwood lump on the right.</h6>


        <p id="indent1"> <b>Charcoal briquttes</b> are probably what you picture when you think about charcoal.
          Typically
          the cheaper
          option, they're uniform nuggets of dense, packed sawdust, and they offer an even, predictable, long-burning
          heat that’s great for grilling larger pieces of meat that take a long amount of time to cook through.</p>

        <p id="indent2">Because briquettes aren’t 100 percent wood (they’re packed with binders to hold their shape),
          they're
          technically the less natural option, but if you’re planning on grilling all afternoon, consider these nuggets
          your economical, dependable, workhorse.</p>
        <p id="indent3"><b>Hardwood lump charcoal</b>is your other option—and it's all about flavor. Made from
          irregularly-shaped
          pieces of real hardwood (no filler or binding agents—just trees!), it burns hotter, less evenly, and more
          quickly than briquettes. Hardwood lump imparts flavor on the food you’re grilling because it’s an ingredient
          in itself: Depending on what kind of hardwood lump you're using, be it mesquite, applewood, or pecan, your
          food will taste taste (and smell) different.</p>

        <p id="indent4"> We use hardwood lump for quick, hot-and-fast grilling (say you're grilling bread or sliced
          squash or hot dogs
          and burgers), but here's a pro tip: You can also throw a handful on top of already-burning briquettes to
          create a plume of aromatic wood smoke so that you can have some of the benefits of both types of charcoal.</p>

        <p id="indent5">To summarize, here's <b>our rule of thumb:</b> If you’re grilling something that’s
          quick-cooking, like thin-cut
          pork chops or smaller vegetables like string beans, asparagus, or snap peas, you want the high-heat fire of
          hardwood. If you’re going low and slow on a whole chicken or a large steak, briquettes are your best friend.
          Either way, dinner’s better when you know you’re using the right charcoal.</p>

        <div id="inner-grid">
          <div><b>Oak</b><br><br>
            Oak is the quintessential go-to for smoking meat. It is a great place to start if you are a newbie to
            smoking. It will lend a medium to a strong flavor that is seldom overpowering.<br><br>
            <b>Best Meat to Smoke</b><br>Lamb, beef, brisket, and sausages.
          </div>
          <div><b>Hickory</b><br><br>
            The most versatile choice as it can be used to smoke wood in many ways. Be careful, though, because too much
            hickory flavor will cause your meat to have a more bitter flavor. It has a sweet, savory, and hearty, a bit
            bacony.<br><br>
            <b>Best Meat to Smoke</b><br>Larger cuts of ribs and pork shoulders, as well as almost all red meat and
            poultry.
          </div>
          <div><b>Maple</b><br><br>
            One of the most subtle smoking wood, it will impart a more subtle smoke flavor. Use maple for a sweet,
            light, mild smokiness.<br><br>
            <b>Best Meat to Smoke</b><br>Poultry, pork, game foul.
          </div>
          <div><b>Mesquite</b><br><br>
            A hardy wood packing intense flavor. It is recommended for grilling, or to be used in smaller quantities. It
            is famous for its strong, intense, and unique.<br><br>
            <b>Best Meat to Smoke</b><br>Red Meat and for adding additional flavor when grilling.
          </div>
          <div><b>Pecan</b><br><br>
            Pecan will lend a rich, sweet, nutty flavor. In fact, the wood is so sweet that you may want to use a
            combination of it with another harder wood to balance out the flavor.<br><br>
            <b>Best Meat to Smoke</b><br>Briskets, roasts, and ribs
          </div>
          <div><b>Apple</b><br><br>
            Applewood is mild and sweet, lending a mellow flavor. Apple smoke flavors take a while to permeate the meat,
            so anticipate several hours of smoking.<br><br>
            <b>Best Meat to Smoke</b><br>Chicken, wild foul, pork
          </div>
          <div><b>Alder</b><br><br>
            A very light and sweet flavor profile. It lends a delicate and sweet characteristic.<br><br>
            <b>Best Meat to Smoke</b><br>Fish, like salmon and other Pacific Northwestern types.
          </div>
          <div><b>Cherry</b><br><br>
            Cherry is mild and fruity, and when mixed with other hardwood like hickory, the two flavors compliment each
            other for an amazing result.<br><br>
            <b>Best Meat to smoke</b><br>Chicken, turkey, ham
          </div>
        </div>
        <h2 id="centered2">Woods to Avoid Smoking</h2>
        <p id="indent11"> Now, don’t just go throwing any type of wood into your outdoor smoker. Keep in mind, some wood
          may replace the smoked meaty flavor with a bitter charcoal taste. Therefore, some woods to avoid include
          cypress, cedar, eucalyptus, elm, fir, pine, spruce, redwood, and sycamore. Additionally, avoid using painted
          or treated pieces of wood to smoke your meat, as they may release toxins into your food.</p>
