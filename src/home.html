        <p> At <b>OneStop Meat Smoking</b>, smoking meat is what we do. We take pride in our BBQ, which is a perfect balance of
          the right amount of smoke, and our delicious house-made sauces. In fact, we are the only restaurant,
          currently, in Edmonton with an outdoor smoker. That is also why we get the common questions of ‘what is the
          best wood for smoking meat?’<br>

          When it comes to smoking meat, there are recommendations of meat/wood combinations. For example, for heavier
          meats, like beef and pork, hardwood is recommended. For more delicate meats, like chicken and fish, a lighter
          hardwood is suggested. Avoid using softwoods like pine and cedar. These woods are too resinous and can ruin
          the meat and your smoker. Head on over to the accessory page to find out more on what type of wood you could
          use to smoke your food with today!</p>
